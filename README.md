# Analysis and Implementation on IRIS dataset
This is the folder where iris dataset has been implemeneted with six different algorithms. Even, the EDA process has been done with the help of seaborn.

Output for KNN is as follows:
Accuracy = 0.96
             precision    recall  f1-score   support

          0       1.00      1.00      1.00        25
          1       0.96      0.92      0.94        25
          2       0.92      0.96      0.94        25

avg / total       0.96      0.96      0.96        75

 Following ML algorithms implementation can be visualised in other notebooks.
